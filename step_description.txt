    Create an account at github.com. I recommend using your Luther email address. Your school email allows you to have unlimited private repositories (and some additional perks) as a student.
    Create a new Git repository at GitHub. The name is not important, but you may want to include the course name or number in it.
    Clone the repository on your Linux machine.
    Create and edit a new text file with a description of the steps you are taking to complete this assignment.
    Stage (add) the file, commit it, and push the commit to GitHub.
    Go to GitHub and edit the text file you just created. Commit your change via GitHub web interface.
    Return to the Linux machine and issue the git pull command from within your repository directory. You should see the updated file on Linux now.
    Delete (rm) the text file you are working with.
    Use git checkout to restore the deleted file.
    Follow this tutorial to enable access to the repository over SSH.
